# CIForms

This Mediawiki extension allows rapid creation of forms, either standard forms with input fields aimed at receiving data from visitors, or forms with multiple choice questions or even Cloze tests to be used as teaching tools for current students or to engage prospective ones.

All forms include automatic validation, are protected by the latest version of Google recaptcha and have been inspired by this extension at Wikiversity and they diverge from it mainly because the submitted data are sent to the provided email address, rather than used to compute a score...
